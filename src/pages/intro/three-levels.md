## Three Levels for Thinking About Code

Let's start thinking about thinking about programming, with a model that describes three different levels that we can use to think about code. The levels, from highest to lowest, are paradigm, theory, and craft. Each level provides guidance for the ones below.

The paradigm level refers to the programming paradigm, such as object-oriented or functional programming. You're probably familiar with these terms, but what exactly is a programming paradigm? To me, the core of a programming paradigm is a set of principles that define, usually somewhat loosely, the properties of good code. A paradigm is also, implicitly, a claim that code that follows these principles will be better than code that does not. For functional programming I believe these principles are composition and reasoning. I'll explain these shortly. Object-oriented programmers might point to, say, the SOLID principles as guiding their coding decisions.

The importance of the paradigm is that it provides criteria for choosing between different implementation strategies. There are many possible solutions for any programming problem, and we can use the principles in the paradigm to decide which approach to take. For example, if we're a functional programmer we can consider how easily we can reason about a particular implementation, or how composable it is. Without the paradigm we have no basis for making a choice.

The theory level translates the broad principles of the paradigm to specific well defined techniques that apply to many languages within the paradigm. We are still, however, at a level above the code. Design patterns are an example in the object-oriented world. Algebraic data types are an example in functional programming. Most languages that are in the functional programming paradigm, such as Haskell and O'Caml, support algebraic data types, as do many languages that straddle multiple paradigms, such as Rust, Scala, and Swift.

The theory level is where we find most of our programming strategies.

At the craft level we get to actual code, and the language specific nuance that goes into it. An example in Scala is the implementation of algebraic data types in terms of `sealed trait` and `final case class` in Scala 2, or `enum` in Scala 3. There are many concerns at this level that are important for writing idiomatic code, such as placing constructors on companion objects in Scala, that are not relevant at the higher levels.

In the next section I'll describe the functional programming paradigm. The remainder of this book is primarily concerned with theory and craft. The theory is language agnostic but the craft is firmly in the world of Scala. Before we move onto the functional programming paradigm are two points I want to emphasize:

1. Paradigms are social constructs. They change over time. Object-oriented programming as practiced todays differs from the style originally used in Simula and Smalltalk, and functional programming todays is very different from the original LISP code.

2. The three level organization is just a tool for thought. In the real world it is more complicated.
